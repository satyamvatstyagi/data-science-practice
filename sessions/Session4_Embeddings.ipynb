Even when FPIs are selling occasionally, like in October and November, domestic investors are showing confidence in the market, backed by fundamentals, said Nilesh Shah, CEO, Kotak MF.\\n\\nMoneycontrol News\\n\\nFebruary 19, 2024 / 04:57 PM IST\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRVNL | CMP Rs 266.4 | RVNL stock surged 5.84 percent after the company informed its order book grew to Rs 65,000 crore. The state run company is looking out for projects in off-shore markets, including Central Asia and the UAE and Western Asia, it said in an investors call.\\n\\nThe benchmark indices ended with gains on February 19, led by FMCG and energy stocks. Nifty settled below its all-time high of 22,186.65, hit earlier in the day. Analysts believe that investors must monitor global developments, particularly since there are no major domestic events expected in the near term.\\n\\nThese global factors are likely to have a substantial impact on market movements. Stock-specific actions are to be looked at for potentially outperforming moves, analysts said.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement\\n\\nRemove Ad\\n\\nThe Sensex closed 281.52 points or 0.39 percent higher at 72,708.16, and the Nifty rose 81.55 points or 0.37 percent to 22,122.25.\\xa0About 2,127 shares advanced, 1,312 declined, and 110 remained unchanged.\\n\\nIn the broader markets, BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rose 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.\\n\\nSectorally, Nifty FMCG and Energy led the gains, rising over one percent each. Nifty Pharma also gained nearly one percent. Except Nifty IT, which was down marginally, all other NSE sectoral indices were trading higher.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nLive: Market turns volatile after Nifty hits new high; Banks Sulk| Maruti In Focus | Closing Bell\\n\\nF&O Manual | Indices trade higher; Bank Nifty momentum continues above 46,750\\n\\nAnother all-time high for Nifty, Sensex up 100 points on positive global cues\\n\\nFollow our market blog to catch all the live action\\n\\nFundamental view\\n\\n“There is tremendous investor confidence among domestic investors. Even when FPIs are selling occasionally, like in October and November, domestic investors are showing confidence in the market, backed by fundamentals,” Nilesh Shah, CEO, Kotak MF told CNBC-TV18.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement\\n\\nRemove Ad\\n\\nEarnings growth during Q3FY24, better governance compared to peers, and sound market strength - bearing a few pockets of exuberance - are encouraging further participation, he added. According to Shah, largecaps look far better compared to mid and smallcaps on a risk-adjusted basis.\\n\\n\"An important takeaway from the Q3 results is the improving profitability of India Inc. EBITDA and profit after tax are growing impressively even while sales growth is average. Automobiles, pharmaceuticals and capital goods are doing very well,\" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\\n\\n\"In banking, there is impressive credit growth and improving profitability. PSU banks are outperforming private sector banks due to low valuations which continue to be fair even after the run-up in prices,\" he added.\\n\\n\"Investors should be careful while chasing many mid and small-caps which are rising sharply without fundamental justification. Many of these stocks have very low floating stock and, therefore, can easily be manipulated by a cartel of operators. In the long run, only stocks with strong fundamentals will give steady and good returns,\" Vijayakumar said.\\n\\nTechnical view\\n\\nThe initial sessions of this week will be crucial to gauge market reactions around the 22,100 - 22,150 zone. A continued upward trajectory beyond this range could signal the start of the next bullish phase, potentially opening doors for the 22,380 - 22,500 zone, according to\\xa0Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivative - Angel One.\\n\\n\"Conversely, while dips may continue to be bought into, traders are warned against complacency, given recent instances of severe losses among aggressive traders around this zone,\" he said.\\n\\nAlso Read |\\xa0Nifty hits a fresh record high; Bajaj Auto, Adani Ent, Wipro, SBI Life hit 52-week highs\\n\\n\"Immediate support lies around 21,950 followed by 21,800, with crucial support residing in the 21,550 - 21,500 zone, from where prices rebounded the week. Traders are advised to monitor these levels closely and adjust their trading strategies accordingly, he added.\\n\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:'), llm=OpenAI(client=<openai.resources.completions.Completions object at 0x7c8ba08853f0>, async_client=<openai.resources.completions.AsyncCompletions object at 0x7c8b6c86ec80>, temperature=0.9, max_tokens=500, openai_api_key='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', openai_proxy='')), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page_content', 'source'], template='Content: {page_content}\\nSource: {source}'), document_variable_name='summaries')), document_variable_name='context'), retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['Pinecone', 'OpenAIEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_pinecone.vectorstores.Pinecone object at 0x7c8b6ca8ed10>))"

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.
